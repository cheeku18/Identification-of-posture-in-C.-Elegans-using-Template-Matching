# Identification-of-posture-in-C.-Elegans-using-Template-Matching

Caenorhabditis Elegans, a model organism in biology is used to study the behavior of the neural activity. The locomotion behavior of the nematode is determined to understand the behavior of the nematode which in turn reflects the neural activity. In this study, the posture exhibited by the nematode is studied and is classified either omega turn or not. The study uses template matching techniques from image processing to determine the posture of the nematode. The study performs thresholding, denoising, and different filtering as a part of preprocessing. The study uses template matching using correlation of the input image and the template to identify the postures and shows that the template matching algorithm could succeed when the orientation and the scale is taken into consideration. The study shows that it is very imperative to build a model which is invariant of scale and orientation
